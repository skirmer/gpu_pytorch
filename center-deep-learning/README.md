## GPU Cluster Training with PyTorch and Dask

Presentation to the Center for Deep Learning, Northwestern University

In this presentation, I give a short introduction to Dask and concepts around cluster computing, followed by a demonstration of training an image classifier on a Dask GPU cluster.

The examples given assume that you have a [Saturn Cloud](https://saturncloud.io/) account, and the model performance monitoring requires a [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/) account. Both of these are free and available to the public.

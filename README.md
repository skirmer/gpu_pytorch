# Scaling Up Deep Learning with GPU Cluster Computing

This repo contains materials for a few talks about the general topic of using Dask cluster computing to accelerate deep learning tasks, specifically in PyTorch. 

If you'd like to invite me to give a talk on this topic at your event, let me know on twitter [@data_stephanie](https://twitter.com/data_stephanie) and make sure you read my booking details at www.stephaniekirmer.com.
